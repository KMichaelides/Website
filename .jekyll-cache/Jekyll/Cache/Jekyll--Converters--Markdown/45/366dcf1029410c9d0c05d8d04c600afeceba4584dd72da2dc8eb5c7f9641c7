I"›<p>Andrew comes from Taiwan, where he got his Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s degree in Department of Geography, National Taiwan University. Now, he is studying for a PhD in the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/">School of Geographical Sciences</a> at the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/">University of Bristol</a>, UK. His primary supervisor (advisor) is <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/people/katerina-michaelides/overview.html">Katerina Michaelides</a> and he is co-supervised by <a href="/people/singer.md">Michael Singer</a>.</p>

<p>Andrew is interested in geomorphology, specifically, land surface processes on hillslopes and in river channels. He is currently working with <a href="/">SCI-CLAWPS</a> for his PhD on climatic controls on drainage basin characteristics at the global scale. Climate is understood to be a first-order control on topographic evolution of drainage basins through rainfall, runoff, and erosion processes. However, the expression of climate is challenging to generalize due to limited datasets that quantify topographic metrics in drainage basins around the globe and disturbances of environmental factors. The specific objectives of this study are to: 1) Analyze river longitudinal profile shapes by climate zones; 2) Compile and meta-analyze long- and short-term erosion rates of drainage basin; and 3) Analyze links between drainage basin characteristics and erosion rate.</p>
