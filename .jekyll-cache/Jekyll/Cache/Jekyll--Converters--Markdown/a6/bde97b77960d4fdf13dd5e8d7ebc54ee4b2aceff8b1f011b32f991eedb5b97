I"ç<p>Katerina is a Senior Lecturer in the <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/">School of Geographical Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk">the University of Bristol</a>, the co-lead of the Water Theme of the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cabot/">Cabot Institute for the Environment</a>, and an Associate Researcher in the <a href="https://www.eri.ucsb.edu/">Earth Research Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/">University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)</a>. She received her PhD in Hydrology of Arid Environments from Kingâ€™s College London in 2000.</p>

<p>Her research focuses primarily on processes in dryland environments from a theoretical and applied perspective. This includes research on dryland hydro-climatology, Earth surface processes, and desertification dynamics. For the last 10 years she has been working on understanding why and how dryland fluvial environments differ from their humid counterparts. She leads a multidisciplinary research programme focused on droughts and land degradation in East African drylands of Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia. This research has a strong international development focus and involves the creation of novel tools (including models and mobile phone apps) to aid rural communities in adapting to droughts and future climate change.</p>

<p>Katerina has been awarded research grants from many funders including the <a href="https://www.ukri.org/research/global-challenges-research-fund/">UKRI Global Challenges Research Fund</a>, the <a href="https://royalsociety.org/">Royal Society</a>, the <a href="https://nerc.ukri.org/">UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)</a>, and the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en">EU Horizon 2020 program</a>.</p>
