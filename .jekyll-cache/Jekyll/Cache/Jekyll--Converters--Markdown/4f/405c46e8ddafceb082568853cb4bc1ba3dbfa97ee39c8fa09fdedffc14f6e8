I"œ<p>Dr Singer is Deputy Director of the <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/water-research-institute">Water Research Institute</a> and Senior Lecturer in the <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/earth-ocean-sciences">School of Earth &amp; Ocean Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk">Cardiff University</a>, as well as a Researcher in the <a href="https://www.eri.ucsb.edu/">Earth Research Insitute</a> at <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/">University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)</a>. He received his PhD in Environmental Science and Management from UCSB in 2003.</p>

<p>His research is focused on the regional expression of climate and climate change at and near the Earthâ€™s surface and its impact on process responses to environmental change (climatic and anthropogenic forcing), which is currently a great scientific challenge with societal relevance. Near-surface responses to environmental change are critical to predicting the consequences of climate and land-use changes at the landscape scale, as well as for management on human/engineering timescales. Singer is, at the core, a watershed scientist with a research aim to advance theory and reduce uncertainty about the impact of humans and climate on water resources, water balance, hydrologic fluxes, erosion/sedimentation, and topographic evolution of landscapes.</p>
