Prior to starting there she graduated with a MSc in International Land and Water Management from Wageningen University in the Netherlands and a BSc in Environmental Engineering from the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna. During her Master she focused on studying isotopes in water resources and worked on projects with the TU Delft and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). She is currently working toward her PhD in the <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/earth-ocean-sciences">School of Earth &amp; Ocean Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk">Cardiff University</a> on a <a href="https://www.serdp-estcp.org/">SERDP</a> funded project on how drought impacts soil moisture and water availability in riparian forests in Southern California and Arizona. Her research interests include ecohydrology, dryland ecology, irrigation and water resource management, drought impacts on water resources as well as any isotopic applications in hydrology and climate change related research. A true Austrian at heart, she loves the mountains, opera and a proper slice of cake.</p>
