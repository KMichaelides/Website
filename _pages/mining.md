Mining has a very long-lasting impact in landscapes. This may manifest as topographic transformation that affects runoff generation, flood wave timing, and inundation. It may also involve the introduction of sediment-bound pollutants that undergo biogeochemical transformation to more toxic forms under hydrologic conditions that are suitable for certain bacterial communities. The 19th C. Gold Rush generated both physical and chemical legacies of great consequence to California. The industrial-scale process of hydraulic mining in the Sierra Nevada foothills displaced 1.1 billion m3 of sediment, filling river valleys, and creating anthropogenic fans composed of mine tailings that grade all the way to the Central Valley. We are studying the complex set of processes linking the physical, chemical, and biological environment to better understand the mechanisms and processes by which Hg enters food webs in watersheds. This work has illustrated the importance of river corridors as key locations in the landscape where Hg is converted from inorganic to more hazardous organic forms, where it is bioavailable to food webs.
