Dagmawi Asfaw is from Ethiopia and is currently employed as a postdoctoral research associate working on the [Drought Resilience In East African dryland Regions (DRIER)](https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/projects/drought-resilience-in-east-african-dryland-regions-drier.html) project, funded by [The Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/challenge-led-grants/). In this project, Dagmawi is focused on creating a widely accessible tool for monitoring regional water storage in drylands, and to use this tool for communicating and enhancing social adaptation to short-term climate shocks and long-term changes to regional hydrology in drylands of East Africa. Prior to joining University of Bristol, Dagmawi obtained his PhD at the University of Reading in the Department of Meteorology researching and developing an agricultural decision support tool called [TAMSAT-ALERT](https://www.tamsat.org.uk/) based on historical weather data, seasonal forecasts and numerical models. 

Dagmawi did his MSc in Water Resources and Environmental Management at Leibniz University Hannover, Germany and  his BSc in Land Resources Management and Environmental Protection at Mekelle University, Ethiopia. His research interests include utilization of satellite weather estimates to monitor adverse events, climate change impacts on agriculture and water resources, and development of decision support tools to easily access weather and climate information.
