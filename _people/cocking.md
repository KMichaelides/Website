Katherine is a PhD student in the [School of Earth & Environmental Sciences](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/earth-environmental-sciences) at [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk) supervised by Michael Singer, Mark Cuthbert, Katerina Michaelides and Rafael Rosolem. Katherine completed her undergraduate degree within the Meteorology department at the University of Reading, where atmospheric processes and understanding climate change from a physical perspective was the main focus of the course.  She is working on the EU-funded _DOWN2EARTH_ project, researching climate change projections and impacts in the Horn of Africa Drylands. This involves analysis of how climate change is impacting seasonal rainfall and how this goes on to further effect the water cycle in this dry environment.
