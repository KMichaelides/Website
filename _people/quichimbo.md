Andrés is from Ecuador and is interested in surface-groundwater interactions in dryland regions. He strongly believes that numerical models will help us in enhancing our understanding of surface-groundwater processes which in turn will be crucial for water resources management purposes under the consequences of climate change. He is a postdoctoral researcher on the DRIER project, based at Cardiff, and he is working on the development of a dryland water balance model for application in East Africa. 

Andrés got his BSc in Civil Engineering at the University of Cuenca in Ecuador and after being awarded a scholarship a Master’s degree in Hydrogeology at the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom. His PhD (based in Earth & Ocean Science at Cardiff University), is focused on how to improve groundwater recharge estimates from ephemeral streams in drylands.
