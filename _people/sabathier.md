Romy comes from France. She joined the [SCI-CLAWPS]({% link _pages/home.md %}) research group in Fall 2018. Prior to starting there she graduated with a MSc on Remote Sensing Applied to Environmental Studies from Université Rennes 2 (France) and an MSc in Biodiversity, Land and Environment Management from Université de Sherbrooke (Canada)/Université de Montpellier (France). Before that Romy obtained her BSc in Ecology and Biology at Université de Montpellier. She is currently working toward her PhD in the [School of Earth & Ocean Sciences](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/earth-ocean-sciences) at [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk) on a [SERDP](https://www.serdp-estcp.org/) funded project on how climate impacts riparian forest growth and health in Southern California and Arizona. Romy is interested in understanding how ecosystems evolve and respond to change, and adaptive management practices, with particular focus on wetlands and water-limited ecosystems.
