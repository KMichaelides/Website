Lissa Pelletier comes from Maine, USA. She joined the [SCI-CLAWPS]({% link _pages/home.md %}) research group in Fall 2018. Lissa graduated from Connecticut College in 2015 with a BA.  While there, she majored in Environmental Studies as a Natural Science and double-minored in Biology and Anthropology. After graduating, she worked as an ecological field tech with Stantec, the National Park Service, and the Nature Conservancy. Through those positions, she was able to intimately experience and learn about vernal pools, coastal salt marshes, and streams in the northeast US. She is currently working on a [SERDP](https://www.serdp-estcp.org/) funded project researching the effects of drought stress on riparian trees and forest in the Southwest US through dendrochronology and tree-ring isotopes, and in the process earning an MS at SUNY-ESF in the [Stella Lab](https://stella-lab.weebly.com/people.html).
