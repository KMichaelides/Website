Tamsin is a PhD student in the School of Geographical Sciences at the University of Bristol, supervised by Katerina Michaelides (who took over from Jim Freer in 2019 after he left the University of Bristol), [Gemma Coxon](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/people/gemma-r-coxon/index.html), [Jim Freer](https://water.usask.ca/about/profiles/people/jim-freer.php#research_areas), [Tom Richardson](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/people/tom-s-richardson/index.html), and [Richard Brazier](https://geography.exeter.ac.uk/staff/index.php?web_id=Richard_Brazier) (Exeter), with CASE partner collaborations with [Ben Thorne](https://www.fwagsw.org.uk/faqs/ben-thorne) (FWAG-SW) and [Louise Webb](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louise-webb-18a7028b/?originalSubdomain=uk) (Natural England). Her work is based in Somerset, looking at the effectiveness of Natural Flood Management (NFM) for flow attenuation and flood risk reduction. She is particularly interested in quantifying how different NFM structures respond to rainfall events, their potential for 'slowing the flow' and how this may be upscaled to understand their impact at the catchment scale. Tamsin completed her MSc in Climate Change at the University of East Anglia and BSc in Geography at the University of Southampton.
